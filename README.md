# Do

This is the frontend application for the Do project, a web app that empowers you to get stuff done.

To see what the backend looks like, take a look at [do-api](https://github.com/florimondmanca/do-api).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Quick start

If you have Angular CLI installed, you can use it to start its development server:

```bash
$ ng serve -o
```

As an alternative, you may start the Express server:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
